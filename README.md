### Third Party Resources & Prerequisites
- This application relies on the following open source postcode api [postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io/).
- You'll need to have an internet connection to run this. If your internet connection is slow/prone to dying there's a high chance that the above API will timeout :cry:
- Python 3.0+ installed (not 2 - you'll end up with a tonne of errors)
- You can't have the CSV file open when running the script - otherwise how is it supposed to write to it!
